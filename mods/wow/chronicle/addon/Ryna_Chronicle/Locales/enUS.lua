-- always the fallback. The other Locales/*.lua files are templates for translators, generated from
-- this one: after adding, changing or removing a string here, run (from the repository root)
--
--   node cores/wow/addon/tools/strings.mjs --templates
--
-- which rewrites them with the same keys, keeping every translation already in them. Without
-- --templates it only checks that this list matches what the code uses (L["..."] and N("...")).
-- Debug lines (ns.Debug) are English on purpose and are not listed. A key the core addon's
-- Locales/enUS.lua already has ("on", "never", ...) isn't repeated here: Chronicle's L falls back to it.
